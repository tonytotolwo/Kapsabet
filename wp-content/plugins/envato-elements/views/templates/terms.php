					<p>Hi, we’re Envato Pty Ltd (<strong>we</strong>,
						<strong>our</strong>) and thanks for beta testing our new Envato Elements &#8211; Template Kits WordPress Plugin. This plugin enables you to access ‘template kits’ and other content. A template kit is a collection of tailored templates designed for use with a specific WordPress page/site builder. Together, our plugin, template kits and other content are called our
						<strong>Service</strong>.</p><p>By accessing or using our Service, you agree to these terms and to our Privacy Policy:
						<a href="https://envato.com/privacy/">https://envato.com/privacy/</a>.</p><p><strong>Beta Trial</strong></p>
					<p>Our Service is still in a beta trial. While our intention is to transition to an active product at the end of the trial period, we cannot guarantee the Service will continue in any form after the trial is over.</p>
					<p>You acknowledge that we’re still developing and building the Service so we’ll be changing it from time to time (or may even cancel your use and recall the service completely), and errors and faults are possible. You also agree to follow our guidance on use of our products from time to time.</p>
					<p>You agree to answer our questions as best you can, and to let us record you and your participation. We may keep and use those records for our own internal purposes.

						<li>use the templates in a project created on behalf of a client (remember, that client will be bound by the terms of this license);</li>
						<li>use the templates to create website that are for commercial purposes; and</li>
						<li>combine the templates with other works to form a derivative work (the resultant works are subject to the terms of this license).</li>

						<li>register or claim copyright ownership in any templates or template kits (including where modified).</li>
					</ul><p>We may terminate your license immediately if you breach the terms of this license.</p><p>
						<strong>External Service &amp; Tracking</strong></p>
